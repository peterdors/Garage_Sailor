This is where the main website development for Garage Sailor will be found. 

This folder will contain the html, css, javascript, and imgs needed for the 
front end and back end of the Garage Sailor website.

To use this site to it's full capabilities, you will have to use the Google Maps API's 
for JavaScript libraries. The API libraries used in this project include Distance Matrix, 
Distance Service, SearchBox, & Geocoder from Google Maps. 

You will also have to include the API key for using the Firebase Database by Google as well.
